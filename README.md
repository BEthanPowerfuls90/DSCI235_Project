# DSCI235 Final Project
## By Ethan Powers and Nathan Mitchell

  For this project, we have analyzed data concerning the Winter Olympics since its induction in 1924 up until 2014. The only years in which the Winter Olympic Games did not take place were 1940 and 1944 due to World War II. To guide this project, we have come up with several hypotheses. We will use the data and data visualizations to support or reject these hypotheses. First, though, we wish to see which countries have won the most total, gold, silver, and bronze medals. With this we will plot a medal breakdown for the top three medal-winning countries. This information will be used throughout the rest of the project.
    
  To go along with this preliminary analysis, we have our first hypothesis. We believe that, since the first Winter Olympic games, there has been an increase in the number of medal-winning events. Because of this, we believe that countries will have seen an increase in the number of total medals they have won over the years. A question that this raises, however, is whether or not the proportion of medals won has stayed the same as more medal-winning events have been introduced. To analyze this, we will plot the number of medals won at every game and compare this to the total number of medals the top three medal-winning countries have won and the percent of total medals these countries have won over the years.
    
  A second question that we wish to answer is what the top medal-producing events are for the three countries that have won the most total medals. The results from this will tie into our next hypothesis.
    
  Our second hypothesis that we wish to examine with our data is to see if countries that are known for a specific event rank highest in overall gold medals and overall total medals in their respective well-known event. To go along with this, we wish to analyze if each of the top-three medal-countries place first in gold and total medals won for their respective highest medal-winning sport.

  On top of this, a third question that we wish to answer is which countries place highest in lesser-known events. Curling, for example, is an event at the Winter Olympics, but no immediate country comes to mind as to who may rank best in this event.
